# Sprint 2: From Tool Use to Agentic Systems

This sprint focuses on building LLM agents that can reason, act, and collaborate using tools and APIs.

## Weekly Overview

| Week | Theme | Focus | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | **LLM Agents & Tool Use** | ReAct pattern, function calling, structured reasoning | Build your first autonomous agent that chooses and uses tools in response to tasks |
| 5 | **Multi-Agent Architectures & Memory** | Collaboration, coordination, agent roles, memory | Design and prototype a system where agents interact with each other and retain knowledge across steps or tasks |

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Tool-Using Agent - A CLI or web agent that chooses and invokes tools
- [ ] Multi-Tool Agent - Agent that selects from multiple tools, logs reasoning flow
- [ ] Agent Architecture Diagram - Sketch of how your agent connects to tools and makes decisions
- [ ] Multi-Agent System - A working setup with multiple collaborating agents
- [ ] Shared Memory Implementation - Basic memory layer across agents
- [ ] Framework Comparison Notes - Comparing different agent frameworks
