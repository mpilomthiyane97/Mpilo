# Sprint 1: LLM Foundations → RAG

This sprint focuses on building fluency with Large Language Models (LLMs) and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Weekly Overview

| Week | Theme | Focus | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **GenAI Jumpstart – LLMs in Action** | LLM Understanding, Prompting, dev setup, daily LLM use | Understand what LLMs are, Get hands-on with LLMs, set up your dev tools, and build your first small but useful AI-powered tool |
| 2 | **LLM App Basics – Prompt to API** | App building, embeddings, similarity search | Cement prompt skills, Go from prompts to actual code. Build an app, explore embeddings, and begin bridging prompts with meaning |
| 3 | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Chunking, vector stores, grounding responses | Build a RAG system that augments LLMs with real documents to improve accuracy and reduce hallucination |

## Deliverables Checklist
