# Wavesix AI Engineering Training

This repository documents my journey through the AI Engineering curriculum, focusing on building practical skills with Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agent Systems, and LLMOps.

## 📊 Curriculum Overview

### Sprint 1: LLM Foundations → Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Weeks 1-3)
- Week 1: GenAI Jumpstart – LLMs in Action
- Week 2: LLM App Basics – Prompt to API
- Week 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Sprint 2: From Tool Use to Agentic Systems (Weeks 4-5)
- Week 4: LLM Agents & Tool Use
- Week 5: Multi-Agent Architectures & Memory

### Sprint 3: Production-Ready GenAI – LLMOps, Guardrails, & CI/CD (Weeks 6-7)
- Week 6: LLMOps – Monitoring & Guardrails
- Week 7: Deployment & CI/CD

### Sprint 4: Capstone – End-to-End GenAI System (Week 8)
- Building a real-world-ready, multi-agent GenAI system
